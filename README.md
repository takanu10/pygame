## Brace: Obstacle Dodging Game

  Brace is about a game that involves an impending countdown timer and the
  player is trying to stay alive by avoiding the enemy obstacles (stress). Along
  the way, there will be support obstacles (affirmation) that will increase the
  timer. Stay alive for as long as you can!
  
  If the timer hits zero or the player is struck by stress, then the game is
  over.
